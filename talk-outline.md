### Introduction

I'm Justin Schwartzenberger. Lead Engineer at a company called SoCreate, where we are building a 
screenwriting platform for motion picture, tv, webisodes, etc.

I am also the host and maintainer of AngularAir, a weekly live videocast that explores approaches, 
patterns and tech through discussion and demos.

I am also also a trainer and author and have courses on Pluralsight and Lynda.com for Angular training.

And, I just got back from ngconf where I was a speaker for the second year in a row. This year 
I spoke about embracing component tranquility. Understanding the price we pay to componentize and 
finding ways to become component architects.

I Will be speaking at ng-cruise about template and reactive forms.

### Components

Let's talk about some of the cool things about components.
- encapsulation
  - logic
  - styling
- reusability
  - inputs and outputs

Let's talk about some of the challenges about components.
- component tree
- coupling

Challenges building with components.
- need to spin up whole app
- need to nav to screen that has component
- need to know if it can be reused

How can we solve this workflow
- identify what it is
- provide a way to work in isolation

### Playground for Angular

Playground for Angular
- how it came to be
- what it is
- where to find it

### Demos
- create a sandbox and inline component
  - add a scenario
  - directive
  - pipe too
- create sandbox by a component
  - add scenarios
  - show context
- show scenario settings
- show sandbox settings
- quick recap of use case (to help explain lack of discovery)
- embed mode
- deep linking
- show example discovery app

### Where to from here with the Playground project?
- some clean up of the source code
- spruce up the example apps
- add some more to the docs site

### Wrap up

Thank you!
